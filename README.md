# Improving-Employee-Retention-by-Predicting-Employee-Attrition-Using-Machine-Learning
In this mini project, I created a machine learning model to predict whether an employee will resign or not. The algorithm used to create the model is Random Forest with a recall value of 91%.  Based on the feature importance obtained after the model was built, some of the reasons why employees want to quit are : 
- LamaBekerja, the longer an employee works the higher the likelihood of resigning.
- UsiaHired, the older the age when the employee was hired, the higher the possibility to resign.
- JumlahKetidakhadiran, the more often the employee is absent, the higher the likelihood of resignation.
- SkorKepuasanPegawai, the lower the score given, the higher the likelihood of resignation.
